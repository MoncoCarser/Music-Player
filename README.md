# Music-Player

Database has 4 songs and album covers ready. These are then looped through the music player as user presses play/pause, next, previous -buttons.
Songs could be replaced by adding the audio files in the music folder, adding a picture in the image folder and updating the details into array in script.js.

Most challenging to understand with this project was the progressbar. While most actions can be covered by a short function, this one needs multiple steps to update the progress bar, while having it interactive, and update current time of the song and its duration.
